## Installation
    
npm install
    
## Usage
    
First download the repo, then you change to the drectory where the index.js is and run the command 'node index.js'

Then you follow the prompts for generating your very own SVG file!

## Questions
    
I would like to in the future allow for self inputed points to generate the svgs or add aditional shapes that are more complex.
